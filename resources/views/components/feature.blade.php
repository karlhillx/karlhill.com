                        With over 20 years of experience, I’ve led the creation and launch of high-impact technology
                        solutions across Agile environments. I excel at guiding distributed teams while staying hands-on
                        with code, tackling complex engineering challenges, and shaping user-focused design. I’m
                        passionate about modernizing systems, applying new technologies like AI/ML, and driving product
                        development from vision to delivery. My approach blends technical depth, strategic leadership,
                        creativity, and clear communication—ensuring solutions are not only built, but built to last.
