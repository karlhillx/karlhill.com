                        I deliver secure, cloud-native software that keeps critical missions operational. With 20+ years of engineering experience and a focus on national-security and space-operations environments, I lead teams through complex challenges while remaining hands-on with architecture, automation, and code.

                        I excel at designing systems that are reliable, traceable, and built for high-assurance deployment. My approach blends technical depth with clear communication and cross-functional collaboration, ensuring solutions aren’t just built—they’re operationally ready.
